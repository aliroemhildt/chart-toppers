# Chart Toppers

## Overview

Are you passionate about music, data, and pop culture? Then chart toppers is the game for you! Put your musical knowledge to the test and see if you can guess which song was the Billboard #1 hit of the year.

User's will find four quiz options on the home page: 1980's, 1990's, 2000's, and 2010's. Once a user clicks on the decade they would like to be quizzed on, they will see the first year of that decade and the top fize songs from that year. The user will then click on the song that they think was #1 on the charts that year. Their guess will be saved and they will be brought to the next question. Once they have made it through all of the questions, they will see a results page showing their total score and a comparison of their guess vs. the correct answer for each year. From here, the user can click the "home" button at the bottom of the screen or the "Chart Toppers" logo to be brought back to the home page, where they can choose another quiz or try that one again!
